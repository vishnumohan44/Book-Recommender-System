# Book-Recommender-System
This repository contains a Book Recommender System built using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The system aims to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and similarities between books.

## Introduction

The Book Recommender System utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and similarities between books. By leveraging these techniques, the system generates personalized recommendations that align with users' interests.

## Data

The dataset used in this project should be in CSV format, containing relevant information about books such as title, author, genre, and user ratings. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and does not contain any missing values.

## Methods

The Book Recommender System employs several unsupervised machine learning techniques, including:

- Collaborative Filtering: This method identifies similar users or books based on their ratings or preferences and generates recommendations by leveraging this similarity.
- Content-Based Filtering: This approach analyzes the characteristics and features of books, such as genre, author, and keywords, to recommend items that are similar to the ones a user has previously liked.
